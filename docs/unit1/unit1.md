## LESSON OBJECTIVESLESSON OBJECTIVES
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
-   Explain the difference between cloud native and cloud computing

## Cloud Native
### In particular, we'll look at the following topics in this lesson:

-   Cloud Native Is Not Cloud Computing

-   First Definition for Cloud Native

-   Second Definition for Cloud Native

-   Benefits for you as a customer

   ## Cloud Native Is Not Cloud Computing

Though the terms are often confused, cloud computing and cloud native
are two entirely separate entities:

-   Cloud Computing

-   Cloud native

### Cloud computing:

-   Technical Infrastructure delivered from hyperscaler like Google,
    Azure, Amazon and more.

-   Is the on-demand delivery of infrastructure (hardware/servers),
    storage, databases, and all kinds of application services via the
    internet. Frequently these are delivered by a Hyperscaler like
    Google, Azure and more.

### Cloud native

-   Service based architecture to solve business requirements. For this
    purpose, procedures such as microservices, DevOps, Serverless and
    many other concepts are applied.

-   Is an architecture for assembling all of the above cloud-based
    components in a way that is optimized for the cloud environment.

-   It's not about the servers, but the services. So cloud native is
    also an organizational destination



## First Definition for Cloud Native

 Below is a first definition according to CNCF:

 ### Cloud native computing uses

-   an open source software stack to deploy applications as
    microservices,

-   packaging each part into its own container,

-   and dynamically orchestrating those containers

-   to optimize resource utilization.

    Essentially, cloud native is the name of an approach to designing,
    building, and running computer applications

-   The architecture rests upon Infrastructure-as-a-Service, combined
    with new operational tools and services like continuous integration,
    container engines, and orchestrators.

-   The objective, usually, is to improve speed. Companies of all sizes
    now see strategic advantage in being able to move quickly and get to
    market fast — putting a new idea into production within days or even
    hours, instead of months.

## Second Definition for Cloud Native:
*   Cloud native is about  how we create and deliver, not where.


### The fundamentals of cloud native are most often described with 5
### principles :

-   Containerization

-   Dynamic Management

-   Microservices

-   Automation

-   Orchestration

#### **Cultural principles:**

-   Delegation

-   Dynamic strategy

Let's go more into details and let's briefly consider the individual terms:

#### Containerization

Encapsulating applications together with their dependencies/operating
environment, all in a single package. This makes them easy to test,
move, and deploy.

#### Dynamic management

 Using cloud-based servers that can be flexibly provisioned on demand;
if on a public cloud, which is typical, companies pay only for
resources when they are used.

#### Microservices


Designing applications as a collection of small, decoupled component
services. Each microservice can be deployed, upgraded, scaled, and
restarted independent of other services in the application, and with
no impact on the end user.

#### Automation

 Replacing manual tasks, like maintenance and updating, with scripts or
code so they happen seamlessly and reliably.

#### Orchestration

Tying it all together by automating the deployment, scaling, and
management of containerized applications.

In addition to the more technical definitions, there are two very
important cultural definitions.
 
### **The two cultural principles are:**

 #### Delegation

Offering individuals the tools, training, and discretion they need to
safely make changes, then deploying and monitoring them as
 autonomously as possible (i.e., without needing to hand off to other
 teams or seek permission through a slow management approval process).

 #### Dynamic strategy

 Communicating strategy to teams, but allowing them to modify that
 strategy in response to their results. That is the ultimate purpose of
 the fast, experimental deployment that cloud native provides: there's
 no point running experiments if you don't make use of what you learn.

 ## Benefits for you as a customer

 ### The benefits are:

-   Companies can use many it finished parts.

-   This use can be done in microtransactions.

-   Companies can scale globally if successful.

-   If the application is not used, for example in the event of failure,
    companies do not have to pay for IT usage.

 ## LESSON SUMMARY

 You should now be able to:

-   Explain the difference between cloud native and cloud computing



 

 ## LESSON OBJECTIVES

 After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Explain the three main types of corporate culture

## The Human Challenge of Cloud Native

 In particular, we'll look at the following topics in this lesson:

-   What is corporate culture?

-   The three main types of corporate culture.

## What is corporate culture?

-   In a business context, the *do* is how the people within your
    organization interact, communicate, and work with each other.

-   In short:

 \- Culture is the way your enterprise goes about creating and
 delivering your service or product.

 If you have the perfect set of cloud platform, tools, and techniques
 yet go about using them in the wrong way - if you apply the right
 tools in an improper way because that is how your culture has always
 dictated you use any and every kind of tool - it's simply not going to
 work.

 At best, you'll be functional but far from capturing the value that
 the system you've just built can deliver. At worst, your system simply
 won't work at all.

## The three main types of corporate culture

 The three major types of culture within enterprises track closely with
 the type of product/service delivery process the organization follows:

-   Waterfall,

-   Agile,

-   Cloud native.

 ### Waterfall

 Waterfall organizations are all about long-term planning. They deliver
 a single large, solidly built, and thoroughly tested deployment every
 six months to one year (perhaps even longer). They are risk-averse,
 with a long decision-making chain and rigid hierarchy.

 Waterfall organizations tend to have specialist teams handling very
 specific skills - security, testing, database administration, and so
 on.

### Agile

 Agile development breaks applications into their functional
 components, each of which is worked on start to finish by a single
 team. Instead of handoffs between specialist teams, Agile has
 cross-functional teams whose members hold all the skills necessary to
 design, build, and test the service they are responsible for
 developing. The result: there are wide responsibilities in a team, but
 a very narrow responsibility for the team. Scrum is one functional
 implementation of Agile process. Roles in this system include the
 teams themselves; Scrum Masters, who facilitate between the different
 process-owner teams; and Product Owners, who have full ownership of
 the delivered functionality and the deadlines.

 Agile-ish organizations are a hybrid breed. Typically they are
 Waterfall organizations that have made some moves toward Agile.

### Cloud native

 Cloud native organizations are built to take optimum advantage of
 functioning in cloud technologies; the cloud of course will continue
 to evolve and will look quite different in the future, but we also
 build to anticipate this. Applications are built and deployed in a
 rapid cadence by small, dedicated feature teams made up of developers
 who also know how to build in networking, security, and all other
 necessities so all parts of the distributed system become part of the
 application. Meanwhile a platform team sits off to one side, designing
 and assembling the platform the developments will deploy to. This
 highly automated platform uses an orchestrator like Kubernetes to
 manage the complexity.

 This organization could also work in an Infrastructure-as-a-Service or
 a traditional virtualized VMware environment. However, taking maximum
 advantage of cloud technology means moving to approaches like minimum
 viable product (MVP) development, multivariate testing, abandoning
 specialist teams for DevOps, and embracing not just rapid iteration
 but rapid delivery/deployment (i.e., continuous integration and
 continuous delivery, even continuous deployment). Some of these are
 part of Agile, at least when fully practiced, but they are all
 necessary for cloud native.

 Cloud native architecture centers on microservices architecture (i.e.,
 de-composing applications into small, loosely coupled services that
 operate completely independently from one another). Architecture then
 influences process: each of these services maps to smaller,
 independent development teams that release iterative software updates
 as soon as they are ready. Rapid release of software creates a tighter
 feedback loop, allowing enterprises to easily adapt and respond to
 customer demands and desires.

### Conclusion

 If a company wants to operate cloud native it must necessarily
 implement the cloud native culture in the company. Otherwise you will
 fail.

 LESSON SUMMARY

 You should now be able to:

-   Explain the three main types of corporate culture

 Explaining Definitions
======================

## LESSON OBJECTIVES

 After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Explain, how the IT stack is structured and how the terms Dedicated,
    Virtualized, IaaS, Container PaaS, Serverless, and SaaS are related
    to it

## Definitions

 In particular, we'll look at the following topics in this lesson:

-   It’s All About Services

-   The IT Stack

-   Deployment Models

## It’s All About Services

 The heart of cloud native is cloud-based services. This is the
 platform upon which we

-   Build

-   Launch

-   Operate

-   Distribute

-   Containerize

-   Automated

-   A modular application empire.….

 In the following we will look at the service models in relation to the
 IT stack.

 



 The figure illustrates the IT stack. 
 
 ### The levels of the stack are

 The IT stack is divided into eight levels below the software
 application.

#### Network

 This layer of the stack allows the software to exchange information
 and data with other computers.

#### Storage

 The next level is the Storage layer, in which the application data and
 the data of the operating system are stored.

#### Server

 Physical server with CPU's and memory.

#### Virtualization

 Is the decoupling between physical servers and virtual machines.

#### Operating System

 Elementary computational and administrative functions.

#### Databases

 Efficient, consistent and durable storage of large amounts of data.

#### Runtimes & Libraies

 Stand-as-stand deployment of programming interfaces and basic
 functions. Utilities (libraries) provide ready-made features.

#### Security & Integration

 Services and Tools to protect the application from unauthorized
 access.

### Dedicated

![](.//media/image17.jpeg)

 Includes the complete IT stack as it was previously used in the onPrem
 environment. The customer is responsible for all levels. Before even
 one application runs, high initial expenses have to be incurred. This
 costs a lot of money and time.

### Virtualized

![](.//media/image18.jpeg)

 Here the customer is only responsible for the storage and network.

### IaaS

![](.//media/image19.jpeg)

 Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS): This is the obvious one, and it
 includes networking, storage, server and virtualization. Hiring
 infrastructure rather than owning it allows you to maximize the
 creativity of each team instead of limiting it to the capabilities of
 a central architecture team.

 IaaS provider (Hyperscaler) are Google Cloud Platform , Azure, AWS and
 many more.

### Container

![](.//media/image20.jpeg)

 Container-as-a-Service: This lets you hand over container engines,
 orchestration, and all underlying (IaaS) compute resources for
 delivery to users as a service from your cloud provider.

 <img src=".//media/image21.jpeg" style="width:5.23656in;height:3.01031in" /PaaS



 Platform-as-a-Service: This can be used to manage and maintain all
 that virtualized infrastructure, greatly reducing the load on your Ops
 (or Platform) team.

 SAP Cloud Platform is a PaaS.

 <img src=".//media/image22.jpeg" style="width:5.1675in;height:3.01031in" /Serverless


 Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the
 cloud provider runs the server, and dynamically manages the allocation
 of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of
 resources consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased
 units of capacity.

 <img src=".//media/image23.jpeg" style="width:5.46812in;height:3.07937in" /Software-as-a-Service
 (SaaS)


 Software-as-a-Service: This allows you to pick and choose component
 applications, everything from traditional business software (think MS
 Office 365 or Google Mail) to virtual infrastructure management tools,
 all delivered via - and operated over - the web. The provider ensures
 security, availability, and performance.

## Deployment Models

 Cloud services differ in different types of deployment. Depending on
 who offers the services and to which target group they are targeted,
 it is referred to as:

-   Public Clouds

-   Private Clouds

-   Hybrid Clouds

-   Community Cloud

### Public Cloud

 The public cloud or public cloud is an offer of a freely accessible
 provider, which makes its services openly accessible to everyone via
 the Internet. Webmailer services or the well-known Google Docs are
 examples of public cloud offerings as well as the paid services of a
 Microsoft Office 365 or an SAP Business by Design.

### Private Cloud

 Private cloud services are on the other hand. For privacy and IT
 security reasons, organizations often prefer to continue to run their
 IT services themselves and make them accessible only to their own
 employees. If these are offered in such a way that the end user in the
 enterprise can take advantage of cloud-typical added value, such as a
 scalable IT infrastructure or installation- and maintenance-free IT
 applications that can be used via the web browser, then is called a
 private cloud. Often, however, these additional values are not or only
 partially achieved in so-called IT infrastructures.

### Hybrid Clouds

 Hybrid clouds are called hybrid forms of these two approaches. For
 example, certain services at public providers run over the Internet,
 while data-critical applications and data are operated and processed
 in the enterprise. The challenge here lies in the separation of
 business processes into data protection-critical and non-critical
 workflows. The prerequisite is a clean and consistent classification
 of the data available and processed in the company.

### Community Clouds

 The so-called community clouds are a rather rare special case. This is
 called cloud infrastructures that are used and deployed by multiple
 organizations, such as in the context of a project, to share access to
 specific services. However, these are not publicly available, but are
 limited to a defined user group.

### Comparison between private and public cloud

![](.//media/image24.jpeg)

 On the left side are the 4 most important influencing factors. In
 addition, the comparison of the deployment models Private - and Public
 Cloud.

 You can immediately see that public cloud is the method of choice for
 fast innovative applications.

## LESSON SUMMARY

 You should now be able to:

-   Explain, how the IT stack is structured and how the terms Dedicated,
    Virtualized, IaaS, Container PaaS, Serverless, and SaaS are related
    to it

 Explaining the Cloud Native Maturity Matrix
===========================================

## LESSON OBJECTIVES

 After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Detect the position of your company in terms of culture, team,
    process and white criteria. With the help of the matrix, you can now
    sketch your goals and how to get there

## Cloud Native Maturity Matrix

 In particular, we'll look at the following topics in this lesson:

-   Cloud Native Transformation - Overview

-   Culture

-   Product/Service Design

-   Team

-   Process

-   Architecture

-   Maintanance

-   Delivery

-   Provisioning

-   Infrastructure

## Cloud Native Transformation - Overview

 Cloud Native Maturity Matrix, a unique framework for evaluating and
 understanding your company where it is right now. The matrix is a
 pragmatic process you can apply to map your current maturity, identify
 gap analysis, and discern where they should focus their efforts in
 order to reap the most benefits.

 This part comes from the book :

### Cloud Native Transformation 
 
 Practical Patterns for Innovation

 Pini Reznik, Michelle Gienow, Jamie Dobson
 
ISBN: 1492048909

 ![](.//media/image25.jpeg)

 As we see, the Maturity Matrix is divided into nine separate areas (or
 axes), each one an individual and essential member of an integrated,
 interdependent system. Each axis is further divided into four specific
 stages of organizational development a company may currently occupy:

-   No process

-   Waterfall

-   Agile

-   Cloud native

-   Next

 We'll take a closer look. We limit ourselves only to the living of the
 Cloud Native and Next specific stages of organizational development.

## Culture

![](.//media/image26.jpeg)

### Cloud native: Collaborative

 A Collaborative organization tends to have big but not deeply specific
 goals (i.e., there may be a wide vision but without a detailed
 specification or a fixed delivery date). This culture embraces
 learning and consistent, continuous improvement over predictability.
 Emphasis is on self-education, experimentation, and research. Results
 are coldly assessed based on field data.

 A collaborative culture is crucial for companies operating in areas of
 high uncertainty or fast change.

### Next: Generative

 We predict the next type of organization will be a Generative one. An
 extension of a collaborative organization, in a generative
 organization IT will co-create solutions as equal partners with the
 business.

## Product/Service Design

![](.//media/image27.jpeg)

 This is the place where we assess just what it is you do and how you
 go about doing it. We evaluate whether you are organized around
 long-term planning, delivering a tightly coupled product on a slow and
 deliberate schedule - or whether you iterate rapidly in shorter
 sprints, ideally using customer feedback to drive the changes.

### Cloud native: Data Driven

 The final say on which features stay in a product is based on data
 collected from real users. Potential new features are chosen based on
 client requests or designs by product owners without a long selection
 process. They are rapidly prototyped and then developed and delivered
 to users with copious monitoring and instrumentation. They are
 assessed against the previous features (better or worse?) based on A/B
 or multivariate testing. If the new feature performs better, it stays;
 if worse, it is switched off or improved.

### Next: AI Driven

 In the future, humans will be cut out of this process entirely!
 AI-driven systems will make evolutionary tweaks and test themselves
 with little developer interaction.

## Team

![](.//media/image28.jpeg)

 Does your enterprise take a top-down, "Do what the boss says"
 approach, likely with highly specialized teams? Or one that is more
 cross-functional, composed of teams where each member has specific
 skills? Possibly you have progressed all the way to DevOps - an
 effective approach that takes advantage of cloud native architecture.

### Cloud native: DevOps/SRE

 Traditionally, developers/engineers have been responsible for building
 software and then handing it off to the operations team for
 deployment. A DevOps team joins the two in a single team capable of
 designing and building applications as part of a distributed system,
 and also operating the production platform/tools. Across the
 organization, each team has full responsibility for delivering an
 individual set of microservices and supporting them. DevOps teams
 typically include planning, architecture, testing, dev, and
 operational capabilities.

 There will still often remain a separation of tasks. For example, it
 is common to see a platform DevOps team in charge of building the
 cloud native platform, while site reliability engineering (SRE) or
 first-level support teams respond to incidents (and spend the rest of
 their time working on automation to prevent them from happening in the
 first place). However, there is considerable collaboration between
 those teams and individuals can easily move between them.

### Next: Internal supply chains

 In an Internal Supply Chain organization, each service is a separate
 product with full tech and business generation responsibilities in the
 teams - much as many ecommerce teams have been managed for a decade.

## Process

![](.//media/image29.jpeg)

 Does your enterprise do long-term planning up front and then follow
 with execution? Or do you change things responsively and on the fly?
 Currently, Scrum/Kanban is what we find most enterprises using. Cloud
 native and CI/CD require the next jump in speed: now developers need
 to be able to deliver every day - and do so independently from other
 developers.

### Cloud native: Design Thinking + Agile + Lean

 Design Thinking and other research and experimentation techniques are
 used for de-risking large and complex projects. Many proofs of concept
 (PoCs) are developed to compare options. Kanban is often then used to
 clarify the project further, and finally Agile methods like Scrum can
 be applied once the project is well understood by the entire team.
 Highly proficient organizations might choose to follow the Lean model.

 This relatively new approach is very effective in situations of high
 uncertainty or where the technology is changing rapidly.

### Next: Distributed, self-organized

 In the future, self-organized systems will be highly experimental.
 There will be less up-front design. Individuals or small teams will
 generate ideas, which will then form the seeds of a new

 product or feature. Once implemented, these will be iterated and
 improved on automatically by the platform.

## Architecture

![](.//media/image30.jpeg)

 Is your enterprise trying "batteries included" to provide everything
 needed for most use cases

 \- the Tightly Coupled Monolith? Or perhaps you have reached the next
 step in the evolutionary architecture chain, Client-Server. The cloud
 native goal is to use microservices architecture where a large
 application is built as a suite of modular components or services.
 Microservices enable development teams to take a more decentralized
 (non-hierarchical) approach to building software. Microservices enable
 each service to be isolated, rebuilt, redeployed and managed
 independently.

### Cloud native: Microservices

 Microservices architecture is highly distributed. It comprises a large
 number (usually more than 10) of independent services that communicate
 only via well-defined, versioned APIs. Often, each microservice is
 developed and maintained by one team. Each microservice can be
 deployed independently, and each has a separate code repository.
 Hence, each microservice team can work and deploy in a highly parallel
 fashion, using their own preferred languages and operational tools and
 datastores (such as databases or queues).

 Because the system is distributed and components are decoupled, not
 only from each other but from other copies of themselves, is it easy
 to scale the system up by deploying more copies of each service.
 Operationally, microservice deployment must be managed in a fully
 automated way.

### Next: Functions-as-a-Service/Serverless

 A Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS, also known as Serverless) architecture
 is one where no infrastructure needs to be provisioned. Each piece of
 business logic is in separate function, which is operated by a fully
 managed Function-as-a-Service such as AWS' Lambda, Azure Functions, or
 Google's Cloud Functions. No operations tasks such as up-front
 provisioning, scaling, or patching are required. There is a
 pay-as-you-go/pay-per-invocation model.

 <img src=".//media/image31.jpeg" style="width:5.74031in;height:1.75906in" /Maintenance


 On this axis we assess how you monitor your systems and keep them
 running. It's a broad spectrum, from having no process whatsoever to
 full automation with little or no human intervention. No Process/Ad
 Hoc means every now and then going in to see if the server is up and
 what the response time is. (And the somewhat embarrassing fact is, a
 lot of folks still do just that.) Alerting means having some form of
 automation to warn when problems arrive, but it is nowhere near fast
 enough for this new world because once a problem is alerted, a human
 being still needs to intervene. Comprehensive monitoring and full
 observability, where system behavior is observed and analyzed so
 problems can be predicted (and prevented) in advance, rather than
 responded to when they do happen, are an absolute necessity for cloud
 native.

### Cloud native: Full observability and self-healing

 In full observability and self-healing scenarios, the system relies
 upon logging, tracing, alerting, and metrics to continually collect
 information about all the running services in a system. In cloud
 native you must observe the system to see what is going on. Monitoring
 is how we see this information; observability describes the property
 we architect into a system so that we are able to discern internal
 states through monitoring external outputs. Many issue responses
 happen automatically; for example, system health checks may trigger
 automatic restarts if failure is detected. Alternatively, the system
 may gradually degrade its own service to keep itself alive if, for
 example, resource shortages such as low disk space are detected
 (Netflix is famous for this). Status dashboards are often accessible
 to everyone in the business so that they can check the availability of
 the services.

 Operations (sometimes now referred to as "platform") engineers respond
 to infrastructure and platform issues that are not handled
 automatically. Live application issues are handled by development
 teams or system reliability engineers (SREs). The SRE role may be
 filled by individuals embedded in a DevOps team or separated into a
 dedicated SRE team.

 Logs are all collected into a single place. This often includes
 distributed tracing output. Operations, developers, and SREs all have
 access to the logging location. They no longer have (or need) security
 access to production servers.

 All update processes are fully automated and do not require access by
 individual engineers to individual servers.

### Next: Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)

 In the next generation of systems, ML and AI will handle operational
 and maintenance processes. Systems learn on their own how to prevent
 failures by, for instance, automatically scaling up capacity.
 Self-healing is the optimal way for systems to be operated and
 maintained. It is faster, more secure, and more reliable.

 Delivery

![](.//media/image32.jpeg)

 Delivery is really all about how quickly you can get things out and in
 how automated a fashion. The Maturity Matrix moves from traditional
 major version releases every six to 12 months to Agile's more rapid
 iterations of weekly to monthly releases. Reaching cloud native grants
 the ability to release daily, or even multiple times per day.

### Cloud native: Continuous Delivery (CD)

 Continuous delivery describes an organization that ensures new
 functionality is released to production at high frequency, often
 several times per day. That does not mean the new functionality is
 exposed to all users immediately. It might be temporarily hidden or
 reserved for a subset of experimental or preview users.

 With CD we typically see:

 A so-called "deployment pipeline" where new code from developers is
 automatically moved through build and test phases.

 Automatic acceptance (or rejection) of new code for deployment.

 Thorough testing of functionality, integration, load, and performance
 happens automatically. Once a developer has put their code into the
 pipeline, they cannot manually change it.

 Individual engineers do not have permission to change the production
 (live) servers.

 Cloud native organizations typically combine integration and
 deployment processes, known as "CI/CD," to drive continuous
 improvements to their systems. They also run tests on their production
 systems using methods such as "chaos engineering" (a way of forcing
 outages to occur on production systems to ensure those systems recover
 automatically) or live testing for subsets of users (for example "A/B
 testing").

### Next: Continuous Deployment

 The next evolution of delivery is continuous deployment, where we see
 fully automatic deployment to production with no approval process -
 just a continuous flow of changes to customers. The system will
 automatically roll back (uninstall) new changes if certain key metrics
 are negatively impacted, such as user conversion.

## Provisioning

![](.//media/image33.jpeg)

 How do you create new infrastructure and new machines? How quickly can
 you deploy everything, and how automated is this process? Provisioning
 is the Maturity Matrix axis where we are happiest to see a company
 leading the other eight areas!

### Cloud native: Dynamic Scheduling/Orchestration (Kubernetes)

 Applications in production are managed by a combination of
 containerization (a type of packaging that guarantees applications are
 delivered from development with all their local operational
 dependencies included) and a commercially available or open source
 orchestrator such as Kubernetes.

 The risk of a mismatch between development and live environments is
 reduced or eliminated by delivering applications from Dev to Ops in
 containers along with all of the app's dependencies. The Ops team then
 configures Kubernetes to support the new application by describing the
 final system they want to produce in production. This is called
 declarative configuration.

 The resulting system is highly resilient, automated, and abstracted.
 Neither engineers nor the apps themselves need to be aware of hardware
 specifics. Everything is automatic. Detailed decision making about
 where and when applications will be deployed is made by the
 orchestrator itself, not a human.

### Next: Serverless

 All hardware maintenance and configuration is done in a fully
 automated way by your cloud provider's platform. Code is packaged by
 developers, submitted to the serverless service(s), and can
 potentially be distributed and executed on many different platforms.
 The same function can run for testing or live. Inputs, outputs, and
 dependencies are tightly specified and standardized. Serverless is
 rapidly being adopted across the cloud native ecosystem and is well on
 its way to becoming standard cloud native best practice.

## Infrastructure

![](.//media/image34.jpeg)

 Everyone knows this one: single server to multiple servers to VMs
 running in your own data center. Then shifting to Hybrid cloud for a
 computing environment that mixes on-premises infrastructure with
 private and/or public cloud services best tailored to your company's
 specific needs and use case.

### Cloud native: Containers/hybrid cloud (cattle)

 Here, individual machines don't matter: they are called "cattle"
 because there is a big herd and they are interchangeable. There is
 usually full automation of environment creation and maintenance. If
 any piece of infrastructure fails, you don't care - it can be easily
 and almost instantly recreated.

 Unlike VMs, these are never directly provisioned; they are accessed
 only through automated processes exposed through APIs. This automation
 means new infrastructure takes minutes, even seconds, to provision.
 Containers are used for application packaging, which makes it easier
 to run those applications anywhere, including different "hybrid" cloud
 environments, whether public or on-premises.

### Next: Edge computing

 The next evolution for infrastructure is edge computing. Decentralized
 computer processing as the edge of your network. Edge computing takes
 applications, data, and computing power (services) out of a
 centralized location and distributes them to locations closer to the
 user. (Kind of like microservices for compute loads, really.) Edge
 computing returns results fast and works well in applications where,
 for example, adequate data is available locally.
