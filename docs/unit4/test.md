> SAP bases its integration strategy for the Intelligent Enterprise on
> four principles:

-   out-of-the-box integration,

-   open integration,

<!-- -->

-   holistic integration,

-   AI-driven integration

> What exactly does that mean? Out-of-the-box integration
>
> SAP software supports end-to-end business processes, including
> out-of-the-box integrations, enabled by a standardized application and
> technology portfolio.
>
> Prepackaged integration content for SAP Cloud Platform Integration
> builds the foundation for integrating applications of the Intelligent
> Enterprise.
>
> Open integration
>
> Besides SAP-to-SAP integrations, SAP is open for any third-party
> integration as well as custom extensions. The foundation for open
> integration is based on public APIs. With the SAP Cloud Platform Open
> Connectors service,
>
> SAP provides feature-rich, prebuilt connectors for more than 150
> non-SAP applications.
>
> Holistic integration
>
> SAP provides a holistic integration technology portfolio that covers
> all flavors of integration. Based on SAP Cloud Platform Integration
> Suite and SAP HANA Data Management Suite, SAP supports all types of
> integration use cases, ranging from process, data, user, and IoT to
> analytics-centric integration. A methodology helps enterprise
> architects shape their integration strategies, which can include
> integration technologies from SAP and third parties.
>
> AI-driven integration
>
> In addition to bringing intelligence into core business processes, SAP
> is using AI techniques to simplify the development of integration
> scenarios. One example is the SAP Cloud Platform Integration Advisor
> service for SAP Cloud Platform Integration. Its crowd- based machine
> learning approach enables users to define, maintain,share, and deploy
> B2B and A2A integration content much faster than building it from
> scratch. Further uses of artificial intelligence in other areas of
> integration, such as for integration monitoring, are planned.

> LESSON OBJECTIVES
>
> After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Explore APIs in the SAP Universe

### APIs in the SAP Universe

> Overview
>
> The SAP API Business Hub is a web application hosted by SAP to
> discover, explore, and test SAP and partner APIs (application
> programming interfaces) that are required to build extensions or
> process integrations.
>
> APIs in SAP solutions use various protocols, documentation, and access
> mechanisms. Application and integration developers must have a
> consistent overview of the APIs available in the relevant SAP systems
> (deployed on-premise and in the cloud). Testing APIs and building
> prototypes also involves organizing access to relevant systems and
> tenants for developers.
>
> SAP API Business Hub addresses these challenges by offering a central
> catalog of APIs, along with an integrated test environment in the
> cloud for easy testing. SAP API Business Hub covers APIs from SAP
> S/4HANA, SAP SuccessFactors, SAP Cloud Platform, SAP Hybris, and more.
>
> SAP API Business Hub therefore simplifies the development process and
> reduces effort for:

-   Application developers when building extensions (for example, when
    building extensions to applications within the same Line of
    Business), mobile applications, or Web applications.

-   Integration developers when developing process integrations to
    third-party systems (Application-to-Application \[A2A\] or
    Business-to-Business \[B2B\]).

> SAP API Business Hub allows you to find and explore APIs and API
> packages (a group of APIs) from SAP (SAP S/4HANA, SAP SuccessFactors,
> SAP Hybris, SAP Cloud Platform, and more) and selected partners. You
> can navigate to individual APIs, their resources, and supported
> operations. The integrated comprehensive API documentation in
> accordance with the OpenAPI specification helps you quickly understand
> the behavior of the APIs.

 Explaining API Management
=========================

> LESSON OBJECTIVES
>
> After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Explain the use of API management

### API Management

> In particular, we'll look at the following topics in this lesson:

-   What can I do with it?

-   Components

-   SAP API Management key features

-   Typical use case

-   Steps to provide an custom API

> What can I do with it?
>
> You can enable enterprise collaboration and co-innovation that means:
>
> What is SAP API Management?

-   Publish, promote, and oversee APIs in a secure and scalable
    environment with the API Management capability. Empower developer
    communities to monetize data and digital assets in new channels,
    devices, and UIs.

-   Common platform to define and publish APIs.

-   Related APIs bundled and offered as a product

-   Comprehensive consumption analytics capabilities.

-   Monetization feature for all API providers.

> Using an API Management layer will allow companies to:

-   Create an Omni-channel experience for customers and employees
    (mobile, web, devices).

-   Implement simplified Integration with various ecosystems (partners,
    suppliers, marketplaces etc.).

-   Expose data with external ecosystems to generate new revenue streams
    (Data-as-a- Service).

> <img src=".//media/image36.jpeg" style="width:5.525in;height:2.54312in" />Components

![](.//media/image3.png)

> The API Management belongs to the Integration Suite on SAP Cloud
> Platform. It has two parts:

-   API Portal

-   Developer Portal

> SAP API Management key features are:

-   Configuration instead of coding

-   Efficient API Publishing

-   Broad analytics

> Further details:
>
> Configuration instead of coding
>
> Managing APIs consists of applying standard features in the areas of
> security, traffic management and mediation. All these features are
> pre-defined within SAP API Management, and simply need to be adapted
> to your needs.This allows to centrally simplify and streamline the
> management of APIs, in order to increase agility and to enforce
> central governance easily.
>
> Efficient API Publishing

 Explaining SAP Graph
====================

> LESSON OBJECTIVES

> After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Explain the use of SAP Graph

### SAP Graph

> In particular, we'll look at the following topics in this lesson

-   What can I do with it?

-   How does it work?

> What can I do with it?
>
> What is SAP Graph?

-   SAP Graph is the easy-to-use API for the data of the Intelligent
    Enterprise from SAP.

-   It provides an intuitive programming model that you can use to
    easily build newextensions and applications using SAP data.

-   SAP Graph wraps the APIs of existing products into a single
    harmonized API layer across the existing source systems.

-   This allows you to easily build applications and extensions for the
    SAP Intelligent Enterprise. SAP Graph is based on OData.

> SAP Graph technology is initially used in the four main processes of
> the intelligent enterprise.
>
> SAP Graph focuses on the Lead-to-Cash (specifically on the SAP S/4HANA
> and SAP C/ 4HANA components and their products), Source-to-Pay and
> Recruit to Retire processes. Other processes and corresponding object
> types will be added in the future.

![](.//media/image43.jpeg)

> In this figure you can see that different professional domains, quota,
> product and order are summarized in one API.
>
> How does it work ?- What do I do for it?
>
> A graph describes a structure of nodes connected by edges, which we
> use to represent any kind of more or less complex networks. Some
> examples of graphs are computer networks with machines as nodes and
> network links as edges, social networks with users as nodes, and
> social relationships as edges. Graphs are helpful to visualise
> relationships as a formal representation of complex networks.
>
> SAP Graph schema
>
> In the Intelligent Enterprise we consider business entities, such as
> sales quotes, products, materials, workforce persons, skills, or cost
> centers, as nodes.
>
> You can follow the edges between the nodes as links. Edges in the SAP
> Graph schema have a direction which makes them directed edges, other
> types of graphs, like road networks, often have undirected edges.
>
> The directed edges in SAP Graph point from one node to another node,
> creating links (connections) between them. The links between the
> directed edges are labelled. However, the labels are often the same as
> the destination.

![](.//media/image44.jpeg)

> The *CustomerQuotes* is a node connected to *salesOrganization* nodes
> by the link with
>
> the *salesOrganization* label. The SAP Graph API helps you explore
> these types of relationships by exposing the business entities as
> resources in its API.

 Explaining the Integration Advisor
==================================

> LESSON OBJECTIVES
>
> After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Create B2B mappings

### Integration Advisor

> In particular, we'll look at the following topics in this lesson:

-   Introduction

-   How does it work ?- What do I do for it?

-   Library of Type Systems

-   Sample Scenario

-   Build a MIG (Message implementation guideline) for source and
    target•Mapping Guidelines (MAGs)

-   Mapping Guidelines (MAGs).

-   Use the proposal service.

-   Generate different runtime artefacts.

-   Use the MAG artefacts within your integration Solution.

> Introduction
>
> What is Integration Advisor?

-   SAP Cloud Platform Integration Advisor is a cloud application

-   It uses a crowd-based machine learning approach to help you create
    integration content(Mappings) very easily.

-   This mapping artefacts can be used within the PI or the CPI.

> SAP Cloud Platform Integration Advisor is a cloud application that
> helps you to simplify and streamline the implementation flow of your
> B2B/A2A and B2G integration process. It uses a crowd-based machine
> learning approach to help you create integration content very easily.
> Tests indicate that you can speed up the content creation to
> deployment process by almost 60% using SAP Cloud Platform Integration
> Advisor. You can also manage and share your content, and leverage the
> content shared by other users of the application with similar business
> needs
>
> SAP Cloud Platform Integration Advisor solves the biggest problem that
> you face in B2B/A2A/B2G integration: multiple business partners who
> use different industry standards like UN/EDIFACT, SAP IDoc and ASC
> X12, to name a few. Each new standard will create a need for a new
> interface that facilitates this integration and doing this manually is
> extremely time-consuming.
>
> With IA, you have a library of type systems that you can use a
> starting point, use the messages in this type system library to:

-   Create a new message implementation guideline (MIG).

-   Create mapping guidelines (MAG) to map the standard you use in your
    business system to that of your business partner's.

-   Generate runtime artifacts (XSLT Mappings) that you can use in
    > different integration solutions like SAP Cloud Platform
    > Integration and SAP Process Orchestration.

> How does it work ?- What do I do for it?

![](.//media/image45.jpeg)

> We will examine the individual steps in more detail below.
>
> Library of Type Systems
>
> The library of type systems is a collection of message templates that
> are provided by agencies that maintain the B2B/A2A/B2G standards. Each
> of the type system is developed and maintained by the agency that owns
> it

![](.//media/image46.jpeg)

> On the screenshot you can see the Business Partner OData interface.
> Type Systems are:

-   SAP IDOCS

    -   ASC X12

    -   cXML

    -   ICA Test

    -   ISO

    -   Odette

    -   SAP S/4HANA Cloud OData

    -   SAP S/4HANA Cloud SOAP

    -   SAP S/4HANA On Premise IDoc

    -   UN/CEFACT

![](.//media/image3.png)

> The source is a Mig OrderRequest based on a SOAP interface. On the
> target side, an ASC x12 Purchase Order interface is created as MIG.
>
> A mapping is then created between the source and the destination. The
> mapping artefacts can then be used e.g. in the CPI.
>
> Build a MIG (Message implementation guideline) for source and target
>
> Message implementation guideline, also referred to as MIG, is used as
> the source or target in a mapping guideline (MAG) of SAP Cloud
> Platform Integration Advisor. This is created using one of the
> messages in the type system that is relevant to your scenario as the
> template.
>
> The MIG contains all the information for implementing a customized
> message interface. SAP Cloud Platform Integration Advisor uses the
> message in a type system as a starting point to ensure that you do not
> have to refer to any additional documents ti implement the interface.
> By providing a MIG, you ensure that all users who are involved in the
> process of implementing the interface have a clear understanding of
> the guidelines.

> Mapping Guidelines (MAGs)
>
> A mapping guideline is the runtime artifact that you use in the
> mapping step of an integration application like SAP Cloud Platform
> Integration. This is used as a reference or guidance for implementing
> mapping in the integration application. By providing such an artifact,
> you simplify the mapping task for users who use messages that adhere
> to the A2A/B2B type system standards.
>
> A Mapping Guideline (MAG) is based on a source and a target message

> Use the proposal service
>
> All proposals are from a centrally provided and trained knowledge

 Explaining Enterprise Messaging
===============================

> LESSON OBJECTIVES
>
> After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Explain the features of enterprise messaging

### Enterprise Messaging

> In particular, we'll look at the following topics in this lesson:

-   What can I do with it

-   Features

-   How does it work ?- What do I do for it?

> What can I do with it Uses cases:

-   SAP Cloud Platform Enterprise Messaging is a fully-managed cloud
    service that allows applications to communicate through asynchronous
    events and seamlessly extend your digital core.

-   Create responsive applications that work independently and
    participate in event-driven business processes inside your company
    and across your business ecosystem for greater agility and
    scalability.

> Features
>
> The service provides the following key features:

-   Decouple communication between applications, services, and systems
    using asynchronous messaging patterns.

-   Publish business events Publish business events from SAP and non-SAP
    sources across hybrid landscapes from the digital core to extension
    applications.

-   Build event-driven extensions Subscribe to business events from core
    SAP systems like SAP S/4HANA, SAP SuccessFactors, SAP Concur, and
    SAP Cloud for Customer or third- party sources to enable
    cloud-native extensions to respond to the latest business
    developments.

-   Seamless connectivity Implement extension and integration scenarios
    through decoupled communication between applications, services, and
    systems as part of the SAP Cloud Platform Integration Suite.

> How does it work ?- What do I do for it?
>
> Development
>
> Enable your application to:

-   Connect to a queue or a queue subscription in the enterprise
    messaging service.

-   Send messages to a queue or queue subscription

-   Receive messages from a queue or queue subscription.

-   Develop messaging applications using Java and Node.js and deploy
    them to the service.

-   Look up events from an event source such as SAP S/4HANA.

-   Use REST APIs for messaging. Administration

-   Create and delete queues.

-   Create and delete queue subscriptions.

-   Generate application confiJurDtLons that facilitate the use of
    protocol agnostic libraries.

-   Check your application confiJurDtLons for missing properties.

-   Create, edit, and delete event channel groups.

-   Use REST APIs to manage queues and queue subscriptions.

-   Create message clients with unique credentials.

-   Provide access rules for each message client.

-   Create a message client with an event catalog.

![](.//media/image3.png)

> An event notifies a receiving application that an object at the event
> source has changed. An event source is the system or application from
> which the event originates. A receiving application needs to create a
> connection to the event source to facilitate the flow of events. The
> service can receive events from an event source, lookup events, and
> discover events. Different event sources can publish events to the
> service.
>
> Asynchronous Messaging
>
> Asynchronous messaging facilitates communication between a sending and
> receiving application or system. Messages are sent to a queue where
> they're stored until the receiving
>
> application acknowledges them. The service provides capabilities for
> storing and transmitting messages through queues and queue
> subscriptions.
>
> <img src=".//media/image100.jpeg" style="width:2.34812in;height:0.65406in" />Queues

![](.//media/image3.png)

> The service enables applications to communicate with each other
> through message queues. A sending application sends a message to a
> specific named queue. There's a one on one correspondence between a
> receiving application and its queue. The message queue retains the
> messages until the receiving application consumes them. You can manage
> these queues using the service.
>
> <img src=".//media/image101.jpeg" style="width:3.51in;height:1.4625in" />Queue
> Subscriptions

![](.//media/image3.png)

> The service enables a sending application to publish messages and
> events to a topic. Topics don't retain messages but, it can be used
> when each message needs to be consumed by a number of receiving
> applications. Topics must be managed through queue subscriptions. In
> queue subscriptions, the service enables a sending application to
> publish messages to a topic that directly sends the message to the
> queue to which it's bound. For example, events from an SAP S/4HANA
> system (event source) can only be sent to a topic. A queue
> subscription ensures that the message is retained until it's consumed
> by the receiving application.
>
> Message Client
>
> A message client allows you to connect to the service through its
> unique credentials to send and receive messages. The message client
> can run within SAP Cloud Platform or outside it. You can create
> multiple message clients that can be distinguished with a set of
> credentials that consist of a namespace and connection rules. The
> credentials must also define the list of queues or topics to which the
> message client can send and receive messages. The credentials are
> stored in the service descriptor that you define while creating a
> service instance.
>
> ![](.//media/image102.jpeg)
>
> The namespace is a unique prefix that defines all the queues or topics
> that have been created in the context of a particular message client.
> When you manage queues or topics in the service, providing the
> namespace allows message clients to identify the queues or topics to
> which communication must be made. The connection rules specify the
> queue or topic to which a message client must publish or consume
> messages.
>
> The default service plan facilitates a connection between different
> message clients in a subaccount through its unique credentials.
> Message clients can communicate with each other using the service.
> Each message client has a set of queues and topics associated with it.
> All these queues and topics belonging to one message client are
> exposed to other message clients through the unique credentials in the
> service descriptor.
>
> Event Catalog
>
> An event source can have a list of events that can be published or
> consumed by the service. This list of events is known as event
> catalog. The catalog can contain events that are to be published or
> consumed. Each event in a catalog has a payload schema. An event
> source can provide an event catalog end point that gives the list of
> events that are published or consumed by the message client.
>
> <img src=".//media/image103.jpeg" style="width:4.61906in;height:1.55594in" />Webhooks

![](.//media/image3.png)

> Webhooks allow you to set up an integration to send real-time data
> from one application to another when an event occurs. A webhook
> subscription notifies the receiving application when an event is
> triggered. The data is sent through HTTP POST to the receiving
> application that handles the data. The exchange of data is done
> through a webhook URL. A webhook URL is configured by the receiving
> application. When an event is triggered, an HTTP POST payload is sent
> to the webhook URL. The data sent to the webhook URL is known as
> payload.

 Explaining Open Connectors
==========================

> LESSON OBJECTIVES
>
> After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Explain the use of Open Connectors

### Open Connectors

> In particular, we'll look at the following topics in this lesson:

-   What can I do with it

-   Use Cases

-   Main Features

-   Connectors

-   How does it work ?- What do I do for it?

> What can I do with it
>
> Our platform - combined with our unique Connectors ( more then 160) -
> is designed to unify the developer experience across all kinds of
> applications and services. Regardless of the application's backend -
> REST, SOAP, Proprietary SDK, Database, etc - SAP Cloud Platform Open
> Connectors creates a unified API layer and standards-based
> implementation across every environment. This ensures that developers,
> integration users, and their use cases are decoupled from the backend
> services on which they rely.
>
> <img src=".//media/image104.jpeg" style="width:5.30562in;height:2.1125in" />Use
> Cases

![](.//media/image3.png)

> We are using SAP Cloud Platform Open Connectors to access data from
> non-SAP application using harmonized APIs from CRM Hubs. This
> harmonized APIs would be managed by SAP Cloud Platform API Management
> where all the security best practices and governance policies would be
> applied. Finally we will be building a Fiori application to display
> this harmonized data from any of the non-SAP CRM applications of your
> choice. A high level solution blue-print of this sample application is
> captured in the below figure.

![](.//media/image105.jpeg)

> Open Connectors is connected to the Linkedin Connector. The provided
> harmonised API is used via Cloud Integration to send a message to
> LinkedIn.
>
> Main Features are:

-   Use our prebuild connectors in your integration scenarios.

-   Design and implement complex integration workflow templates.

-   Define your own resource and create mappings to your cloud apps.

-   Extend a connector or build your own.

-   Querying using the Open Connectors Query Language.

-   Use the SAP Cloud Platform Open Connectors bulk services to upload
    and download data in bulk from an endpoint in a normalized way.

-   Configure security settings and set up your users and accounts.

-   Use the SAP Cloud Platform Open Connectors events framework to
    > receive notifications about changes to resources.

-   Use OAuth Proxy to have multiple environments, such as development,
    > QA, etc, with one endpoint application.

> Connectors
>
> Connectors are pre-built API integration that enables a connection
> into a specific API Provider endpoint (for example: Salesforce,
> Quickbooks, or Marketo). All connectors start with a normalized set of
> features, including authentication, resources, paging, errors, events
> and search. At the hub level, we also seek to support the richer set
> of APIs that an application provides, even when not all the connectors
> in that category share that resource. For example, Salesforce Sales
> Cloud has APIs that many other CRM services do not support. You can
> find these APIs that are specific to just Salesforce in the
> documentation for that connector.
>
> Further facts:

-   Connectors share common services including discovery, search query,
    pagination, bulk uploading and downloading, logging, and interactive
    documentation.

-   Methods are normalized and accessible through RESTful APIs.

-   Complete data payloads are returned in JSON and available to
    transform and normalize to a common resource.

-   SAP keeps each connector up-to-date with changes at the endpoint.

-   Each connector is a multi-tenant connector supporting an unlimited
    number of authenticated accounts with no additional code required.
