-   SAP Intelligent Enterprise strategy in a nutshell.

-   A deeper look at the three levels of Intelligent Enterprise.

> SAP Intelligent Enterprise strategy in a nutshell Intelligent
> enterprises apply:

-   advanced technologies

-   best practices

-   within Agile and integrated business processes.

-   This makes them resilient, successful, and sustainable.

> A deeper look at the three levels of Intelligent Enterprise
> Intelligent enterprises consists of 3 levels:

1.  Business Processes

2.  Applications

3.  Technology

> Let us take a closer look at the three individual areas in the
> following overview picture.

>
> <img src=".//media/image5.jpeg" style="width:4.225in;height:1.66562in" />Business
> Processes
>
> The Level Business Process includes the Business Network. The SAP
> business network will help you to digitalize cross-company business
> processes. The network builds on current procurement, travel, and
> contingent workforce solutions to help intelligent enterprises work
> together to create flexible value chains.
>
> Applications
>
> The Applications includes the Experience Management, the Intelligent
> Suite and the Industrie Cloud. Experience Management understanding
> what people want, and how they feel is critical to making the right
> decisions. Experience management solutions give insight on the
> sentiments and feelings of customers, employees, and other business
> stakeholders.
>
> Intelligent Suite:
>
> SAP offers an integrated suite of applications - the intelligent
> suite- that support your end-to-end business processes. These would be
> S/4HANA with different deployment options, SAP 3 and the various SaaS
> solutions such as SuccessFactoirs, Concur, Fieldglass and many more.
> SAP's industry cloud will enable you to discover and deploy vertical
> solutions from SAP and partners. Industry means „Core Business".
>
> Industry Cloud:
>
> SAP's industry cloud will enable you to discover and deploy vertical
> solutions from SAP and partners. Industry - Means Core Business.
>
> Technology
>
> The Technology includes Business Technology Platform (BTP). Being
> best-run means running sustainably. SAP solutions for sustainability
> will help customers understand and manage their impact on people and
> the environment.
>
> The BTP provides data management and analytics, supports application
> development and integration, and allows you to use intelligent
> technologies - such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and
> the Internet of Things - to drive innovation.

> LESSON OBJECTIVES
>
> After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Explain the ideas and innovations of an experience management of an
    industry cloud

### Ideas and Innovations of the Experience Management of an Industry Cloud

> In particular, we'll look at the following topics in this lesson:

-   X-and o data

-   Industry - Means Core Business

-   New API Framework of the Intelligent Enterprise – SAP Graph and its
    new Business Model

-   Business Process Model

-   Business and Technology Services

-   Vertical Edge

-   The Four Main Use Cases of SAP

> X-and O data
>
> Facts about x-and o data

-   To get a full view of the customers, to improve your business, you
    need not only the (o) opaque data but also the (x) behavioral data
    of these customers.

> <img src=".//media/image7.jpeg" style="width:4.61906in;height:1.45844in" />This
> is summarized again in the following picture.

<img src=".//media/image3.png" style="width:5.96597in;height:1.80972in" />

> On the left side you can see the experience data that describes the
> behavior of the business partner, employee, customer or product.
>
> On the right side you can see the operational data, such as functional
> data of the different modules, as well as the technical data. In
> between is the Business Technology Platform which combines both data
> to a complete view of the customer.
>
> In short:

1.  Operational data are:

    -   All business data

    -   All technical data

> \(x\) Experience data are:
>
> All data that directly affects the customer, emotions, opinions,
> perceptions and many more.
>
> The NEW one:
>
> is now to connect this information. This requires a Technology
> Platform that allows this, in a simple and wise able way.
>
> The technology platform is the SAP Cloud Platform ( BTP):
>
> It is a portfolio of integrated solutions that accelerate
> transformation of data into business value. It includes:

-   database and data management,

-   application development,

-   Integration,

-   intelligent technologies from on-premise to the cloud.

> We will deal with the BTP in detail later.
>
> Industry - Means Core Business Industry cloud is our strategy:

-   To extend the intelligent suite with innovative industry cloud
    > solutions.

-   Built by SAP and our partners in the cloud.

-   Based on SAP Cloud Platform.

-   Running on the cloud infrastructure of SAP and our hyperscaler
    > partners.

> The intelligent suite offers best practices and support for end to end
> processes for all industries as the foundation for:

-   efficient operations of finance,

-   material management,

-   supply chains,

-   or asset management.

> The following picture illustrates the situation
>
> <img src=".//media/image3.png" style="width:5.96597in;height:2.52431in" />
>
> <img src=".//media/image8.jpeg" style="width:4.4525in;height:2.17344in" />In
> the area of applications, you can see the innovative extensions to the
> right of the Intelligent Suite. At the moment the focus is on the 4
> preliminary processes:

-   Design-to-Operate

-   Total Workforce Management

-   Lead-to-Cash

-   Source-to-Pay

> The Intelligent Suite and also the innovative extensions run on the
> technology layer represented by the BTP.
>
> The open business and technology platform supports in particular in
> the following areas:

-   Process Modell

-   Data Modell

-   Business Services

-   APIs

> Let us take a closer look at the individual areas.
>
> New API Framework of the Intelligent Enterprise – SAP Graph and its
> new Business Model
>
> In addition to the well-known API's such as REST, OData and SOAP,
> there is a new innovative API framework based on oData.
>
> <img src=".//media/image3.png" style="width:5.96597in;height:2.45556in" />
>
> <img src=".//media/image9.jpeg" style="width:4.4525in;height:2.08812in" />More
> Details:
>
> SAP Graph is an API for accessing SAP-managed data. It exposes the SAP
> ODM, a unified graph-like domain model of business objects (domain
> entities, like Products, Sales Orders and Customers) and relationships
> (links) to users of client applications, hence its name.
>
> Application developers use SAP Graph as a RESTful service to navigate
> and access the data, regardless of where (in which SAP business or
> industry-specific system) this data resides, on premise or in the
> cloud.
>
> SAP Graph uses open standards like OData v.4 as a single access
> protocol and OAuth for unified authentication. By unifying the data
> access to a single interface, the entry barrier for extending the
> Intelligent Enterprise gets lowered significantly. Overall, SAP Graph
> leads to higher productivity and a better development experience.
>
> If the ODM provides all necessary data objects for your industry cloud
> solution, you must use SAP Graph. SAP Graph is designed for developers
> of extension applications.

<img src=".//media/image10.jpeg" style="width:5.96597in;height:1.73681in" />

> The figure shows a schematic overview of SAP Graph.
>
> SAP Graph combines the data from different business domains. Here e.g.
> products, quotas and orders and makes them available as OData. It is
> more than just views of technical data as it is based on a new
> business domain model.
>
> <img src=".//media/image12.jpeg" style="width:2.72594in;height:1.67781in" />Business
> Modell of SAP Graph

<img src=".//media/image3.png" style="width:5.96597in;height:2.02917in" />

> The model no longer consists of just one professional domain. Combined
> models are created along defined processes. This graph approach is
> used , to connect very large sets of distributed data, to create a
> dynamic schema and to determine the interconnections between the
> online actions for the Intelligent Enterprise processes.
>
> SAP focuses on the following processes:

-   Design-to-Operate

-   Total Workforce Management

-   Lead-to-Cash

-   Source-to-Pay

-   And several cross entities

> Examples of cross entities are :

-   Bank Identifiers

-   Budget Periods

-   Business Partners

-   Checks

-   Company Codes

-   Cost Centers

-   Country Codes

-   Currency Codes

-   And more- see https://beta.graph.sap

### The Business Process Model

> Business Process Model
>
> The data model, domain model, and APIs are important to give industry
> cloud solutions access to the end-to-end process support in the
> intelligent suite. Understanding the effects of invoking an API that
> creates, deletes, or changes an object in the intelligent suite
> requires a business process model that describes the side effects of
> those operations.
>
> SAP provides the business architecture framework serving as the
> foundation that helps developers design, build, test, and validate
> industry cloud solutions.
>
> Each industry cloud solution also comes with content from SAP Model
> Company services and content that describes how to configure the
> intelligent suite to enable plugging in the solution.
>
> Business and Technology Services
>
> Industry cloud solutions have ready access to a broad range of
> business and technology services that make life easy for developers.
>
> These range from simple business services such as currency or unit
> conversion to Leading edge artificial intelligence and machine
> learning libraries. With user experience libraries, solution designers
> can give users a seamless experience as they run end-to-end processes
> that span multiple industry cloud solutions, the intelligent suite,
> and business networks.
>
> Subscription management, invoicing, usage monitoring, and application
> support are also managed through integrated central services.
>
> Vertical Edge
>
> <img src=".//media/image13.jpeg" style="width:3.70906in;height:2.51469in" />Every
> path needs goals and waypoints. On the way to the Intelligent
> Enterprise, SAP describes goals and waypoints for several industries.
> The goals are known as vertical edges.

<img src=".//media/image3.png" style="width:5.96597in;height:2.88681in" />

> The individual industrial sectors are divided into columns. The
> journey begins from below. Taking Human Resources as an example, this
> looks like this.
>
> Further Facts:
>
> Best Practices - Now
>
> Onboarding employees quickly and seamlessly.
>
> Next Practices - Next Step
>
> Identifying and securing talent for prosumer engagement.
>
> Vertical Edge - Goal
>
> Identifying, forecasting, and addressing skill gaps Empowering
> employees to make decisions in real time.
>
> The Four Main Use Cases of SAP
>
> In order to make the many innovations, ideas and innovations available
> to the customer, SAP applies this to 4 selected process.

<img src=".//media/image14.jpeg" style="width:5.96597in;height:3.11389in" />

> On the picture you can see the four main customer processes that are
> currently in the focus. The processes are divided into uses cases.
>
> The processes are :

-   Design-to-Operate

-   Total Workforce Management

-   Lead-to-Cash

-   Source-to-Pay

> Get Deeper
>
> Design-to-Operate (D2O)
>
> Is the Digital Supply Chain & Manufacturing contribution to the
> Intelligent Enterprise Suite and delivers a seamlessly integrated
> Supply Chain which is enriched by intelligent technologies across the
> entire Digital Supply Chain portfolio:

-   including Design,

-   Plan,

-   Manufacture,

-   Deliver,

<!-- -->

-   and Operate solutions,

> primarily from a Manufacturer and Operator perspective, with a
> principle focus on manufacturing industries in the initial delivery.
>
> Total Workforce Management
>
> Manages all aspects of the total workforces (employees and external
> workers) in line with company's business objectives and a clear line
> of sight into the financial impact. It enables the end-to-end business
> process of planning, sourcing, and managing the total workforce, and
> facilitates a holistic talent strategy to achieve agility and
> game-changing business outcomes.
>
> The Total Workforce Management includes all the activities needed to
> maintain a productive workforce, such as:

-   the Core HR management,

-   performance and training

-   management,

-   but also recruiting,

-   forecasting,

-   etc.

> Lead to Cash
>
> Typically one of the most important business process for many
> companies, because it is the process ultimately responsible for
> driving revenue for an organization. From a high level perspective,
> the Lead-to-Cash process connects a customer's interest to buy (SAP
> C/4 HANA) to a company's realization of revenue (in the back-end SAP
> S/4HANA system), bringing the front office together with back office.
>
> Source-to-Pay
>
> While companies often focus on revenue, sourcing and procurement
> savings can increase profits about five times more. In the Intelligent
> Enterprise process definition, both the steps - Sourcing and
> Procurement are comprised - with Sourcing being the strategic process
> of ensuring, e.g that the right suppliers get chosen. And Procurement
> being the operational process that takes care of the actual
> procurement of direct material, indirect materials, or services

<img src=".//media/image3.png" style="width:5.96597in;height:2.04097in" />

> The Cloud Platform consists of two main areas:

-   The Integration Suite

-   The Extension Suite

> On the left-hand side, you see all the cloud systems that are out
> there in the world, may it be an SAP system or a non SAP system.
>
> And on the right-hand side, you see systems on premise. So here SAP
> systems with SAP S/ 4HANA or an S/4 Enterprise Suite, for instance,
> but it could also be non-SAP systems.
>
> Integration Suite Integration Suite

-   Makes sure that you have the right data at the right time in the
    right system whenever you need that.

> Extension Suite
>
> The Extension Suite comes:

-   with best run methodologies

-   and guidance

-   and guidelines

-   for the customers on how to implement a good user experience, a good
    process integration, and more.

> So we don't just put the tools in place, but we also provide the
> guidance for the customers to leverage those tools and services and to
> achieve their goals much faster. Also, on the right- hand side, you
> see the ready-to-use business content.
>
> So the SAP Cloud Platform is not just a set of tools, it also provides
> ready-to-use business content that helps you to integrate and extend
> in the best possible way and in the fastest way.
>
> With the integration and extension suite, we will be working
> intensively afterwards. We'll take a closer look at the Business
> Technology Platform - Cloud Platform in a separate chapter
